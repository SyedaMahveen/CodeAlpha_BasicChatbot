DESCRIPTION:

📂 Task 3 – Basic Chatbot
🤖 Basic Chatbot – Python Project
📌 About the Task

The Basic Chatbot is a simple conversational program created using Python. It is rule-based and responds to greetings, simple questions, and ends the conversation when the user types "bye".

It is a beginner-friendly chatbot project, but it lays the foundation for developing AI-based chatbots in the future.
